When you launch the app for the first time, mock data will appear on the screen.

When the app first loads you will be presented with the Decks screen which will display a list of all of your Decks. If there are no Decks, you should see the message "No decks".
To create a new deck, click the "AddDeck" tab from the main page.
After creating a deck, you will be taken to the Deck view. It is also possible to get to the Deck view from clicking on the desired deck from the Decks view.
Deck page displays buttons for Start Quiz, Add Card and Delete Deck.

Create Card
To create a new card you will be taken to the Add Card view fron the Deck page. Here you will be able to provide a question and an answer. Clicking the Submit button will save the card to the specific deck.

Start Quiz
A quiz is the process of reviewing each card in a specific deck. To take a quiz, click the "Start Quiz" button from the Deck view.
Each question is displayed one at a time.The answer to each question can be displayed using the "Question/ Answer" tab at the top of the page. After a guess at the answer has been made, you can indicate whether or not your guess was correct using the correct, or incorrect buttons. Clicking either the correct or incorrect button will display the next question.
After all the cards have been presented, your final score will be displayed. From there you will be able to return back to the Deck view or Restart the Quiz.
